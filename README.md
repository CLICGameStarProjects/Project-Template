## Generalities
*This is a template to create new projects for Game\*. It is to be used more as a guide than as a convention, so feel free to modify it as you please.*

*In this section, explain more in details what the project is and the commands. Maybe mention if a particular game should be used.*

*Feel free to do a little table as below to explain the commands!*

The mapping of the controls is done as follows:

| On the bike            | Player 1 | Player 2    | Effect        |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Pedal                  | W        | Up arrow    | Accelerate    |
| Left handlebar button  | A        | Left arrow  | Turn left     |
| Right handlebar button | D        | Right arrow | Turn right    |
